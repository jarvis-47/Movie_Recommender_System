# Enhancing Recommendation Systems: A comparative analysis of matrix factorization techniques and collaborative filtering integration

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an advanced movie recommendation system, leveraging the power of matrix factorization techniques. The project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how various matrix factorization methods, particularly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), can be integrated with collaborative filtering to enhance the effectiveness of recommendation systems.

## Key Features
* Implementation of SVD and NMF for accurate movie recommendations.
* Comparative analysis of matrix factorization techniques in terms of RMSE and Mean Absolute Errors.
* Exploration of collaborative filtering integration for improved prediction accuracy.
* Addressing challenges such as the cold start problem in recommendation systems.

## Technical Stack
* **Data Analysis and Matrix Factorization:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
* **Machine Learning Models:** SVD, NMF
* **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE
* **Dataset:** Netflix Prize dataset

## Methodology
* The project utilizes a subset (25%) of the Netflix Prize dataset, comprising user ratings for a wide range of movies.
* Two primary matrix factorization techniques, SVD and NMF, are applied to this dataset.
* The user-item ratings matrix is decomposed to uncover latent factors influencing user preferences.
* Evaluation of the models is conducted using RMSE and MAE metrics.

## Results
* The application of SVD and NMF demonstrated distinct strengths in recommendation accuracy.
* Comparative results indicated that SVD achieved lower RMSE and MAE values than NMF.
* Visual representation of recommendations for a sample user, showcasing the model's effectiveness.

## Future Scope
* Addressing the cold start problem by integrating content-based filtering techniques.
* Exploring hybrid models and transfer learning methods for new users or items.
